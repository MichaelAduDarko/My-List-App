# My List App
 This project is a toDo app that helps you list down your daily activists.
 Built this app programmatically from scratch to finish without storyboard.
 Used Apple framework CoreData to save user input.
 Made my own CAGradientLayer for the UI.
 Implemented custom subclasses for clean and reusable code.
 Customize my own UITableViewCells.
 UILayoutContraints were set programmatically.
